SpeedDating VR is a speed dating app made in Unity that prioritizes personality over appearance in an anonymous 
VR environment.  Users can customize their own avatar and background.  Much like the real-life counterpart, 
users have a limited time to interact with their date until they are whisked off to another paretner's room.  
Users are able to like and reject date partners using their environment or discretely using their controllers.  
If two users like each other, then their contact information is shared between them so they can contact each other 
outside the app.

====================================== What we have accomplished so far ===========================================

We have created a prototype simulation of what the essential user interaction will be.  The interaction is not live,
instead we use 3 computer avatars with their own personalized rooms that the user can interact with.

Users are able to like, reject the computer avatars.  Feedback will be given to the user based on their choices.

Due to the time constraint and resources, we were not able to create our own art assets to use in the prototype.
Free assets from the Unity store were used to create our protytpe.

=============================================== Future Potential ==================================================

In the future, users will be able to register their account and be able to provide their information that will aide
us in preselecting partners they can interact with.  This information can also be used to share amongst users who
mutually "like" each other.

Users will also be able to customize their rooms and avatars using a visual editor.

This app will follow the Freemium model.  While the base experience is free, users can pay money to further
customize their avatars as well as maybe providing a more premium experience.

Further monetization can be accomplished by allowing companies to provide customization packages for avatars and
rooms.  For example: J.Crew could create virtual clothes that users can buy to customize their avatars.  Or movie
studios can provide assets users can use to customize their rooms to promote upcoming movies.
